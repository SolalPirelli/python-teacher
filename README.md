# "Python Teacher"

Based on Azure's Django sample, available at https://github.com/Azure-Samples/msdocs-python-django-webapp-quickstart, MIT licensed (c) Microsoft Corporation.

The `.gitignore`, `infra`, `manage.py`, and `quickstartproject` folders/files are left as-is from the template.
A real app would probably change/specialize them.
